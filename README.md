# General_EU_health_care_system_quality_statistics
I asked AnswerAI for some statistics about EU healthcare system quality statistics these are the results:
1. Life Expectancy: The average life expectancy in the EU is around 81 years for men and 85 years for women.
2. Infant Mortality: The EU has made significant progress in reducing infant mortality rates. The average infant mortality rate in the EU is around 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births.
3. Access to Healthcare: The EU has achieved a high level universal healthcare coverage. Approximately 99% of the population in the EU have access to healthcare services.
4. Hospital Beds: The number of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants varies across EU countries. In 2018, the EU average was approximately 5 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants.
5. Wait Times: Wait times for specialized treatments and elective surgeries can vary across EU countries. On average, patients in the EU can expect to wait around 6-8 weeks for non-emergency surgery.
6. Health Expenditure: The average health expenditure in the EU is around 9.9% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). However, there are variations among countries, with some spending more and others spending less.
Please note that these statistics are general figures and can vary based on individual countries within the European Union. For more precise and country-specific information, it is recommended to refer to reports and data from reputable sources like Eurostat or the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.
Note: The health expenditure in in EU is not too high(9,9% of GDP) result is waiting times to be high. It's my humble opinion, but I believe there is much to improve in this direction. Waiting times is not an easy problem but lately there were even cases with preagnant women and people with cancer waiting a big amount of time for a treatment, with bad results for their health.
